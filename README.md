# WIP Rust API client for Grist

The client was originally intended to use the OpenAPI specification. However, it turned out specification had some issues and was unable to generate the code. I was able to fix the issues that prevented code generation and got it to compile.
I've cleaned up the code a little and got everything is working for my own project, but some other parts might still be faulty
If you want to use this and find any issues for your own projects, please create a PR with the fixed code.
