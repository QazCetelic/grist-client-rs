# WIP Rust API client for Grist

The client was originally intended to use the OpenAPI specification, but it turned out [specification had some issues](https://github.com/gristlabs/grist-help/issues/501) and was unable to generate the code.
I was able to fix the issues that prevented code generation, got it to compile, cleaned up the code a little, and got everything is working for my own project, but some other parts might still be faulty.  
If you would like to interact with Grist in your Rust code and find any issues for your own projects, please create a PR with the fixed code.
